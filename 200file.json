{"abstract": "  A fully differential calculation in perturbative quantum chromodynamics is\npresented for the production of massive photon pairs at hadron colliders. All\nnext-to-leading order perturbative contributions from quark-antiquark,\ngluon-(anti)quark, and gluon-gluon subprocesses are included, as well as\nall-orders resummation of initial-state gluon radiation valid at\nnext-to-next-to-leading logarithmic accuracy. The region of phase space is\nspecified in which the calculation is most reliable. Good agreement is\ndemonstrated with data from the Fermilab Tevatron, and predictions are made for\nmore detailed tests with CDF and DO data. Predictions are shown for\ndistributions of diphoton pairs produced at the energy of the Large Hadron\nCollider (LHC). Distributions of the diphoton pairs from the decay of a Higgs\nboson are contrasted with those produced from QCD processes at the LHC, showing\nthat enhanced sensitivity to the signal can be obtained with judicious\nselection of events.\n", "title": "Calculation of prompt diphoton production cross sections at Tevatron and\n  LHC energies", "authors": "C.

These velocities are consistent with those of material circulating at the\nouter edge of the accretion disc, suggesting corotation of the accretion\ncurtain with material near the Roche lobe radius. Furthermore, spin Doppler\ntomograms have revealed evidence of the accretion curtain emission extending\nfrom velocities of ~500 km/s to ~1000 km/s. These findings have confirmed the\ntheoretical model predictions of King & Wynn (1999), Belle et al. (2002) and\nNorton et al.

This general approach enables us not only to improve known results\non the adiabatic evolution of isolated solitary waves and periodic wave trains\nin the presence of variable topography and bottom friction, modeled by the\nChezy law, but also importantly, to study the effects of these factors on the\npropagation of undular bores, which are essentially unsteady in the system\nunder consideration. In particular, it is shown that the combined action of\nvariable topography and bottom friction generally imposes certain global\nrestrictions on the undular bore propagation so that the evolution of the\nleading solitary wave can be substantially different from that of an isolated\nsolitary wave with the same initial amplitude. This non-local effect is due to\nnonlinear wave interactions within the undular bore and can lead to an\nadditional solitary wave amplitude growth, which cannot be predicted in the\nframework of the traditional adiabatic approach to the propagation of solitary\nwaves in slowly varying media.\n", "title": "Evolution of solitary waves and undular bores in shallow-water flows\n  over a gradual slope with bottom friction", "authors": "G.A.

For very rapidly rotating black holes (spin\na=J/M>0.9524M) we have found a class of very strong field eccentric orbits\nwhose angular momentum L_z increases with the orbit's inclination with respect\nto the equatorial plane, while keeping latus rectum and eccentricity fixed.\nThis behavior is in contrast with Newtonian intuition, and is in fact opposite\nto the \"normal\" behavior of black hole orbits. Such behavior was noted\npreviously for circular orbits; since it only applies to orbits very close to\nthe black hole, they were named \"nearly horizon-skimming orbits\". Our analysis\ngeneralizes this result, mapping out the full generic (inclined and eccentric)\nfamily of nearly horizon-skimming orbits. The earlier work on circular orbits\nreported that, under gravitational radiation emission, nearly horizon-skimming\norbits tend to evolve to smaller orbit inclination, toward prograde equatorial\nconfiguration. Normal orbits, by contrast, always demonstrate slowly growing\norbit inclination (orbits evolve toward the retrograde equatorial\nconfiguration).

Using kludge fluxes\nbased on a Post-Newtonian expansion corrected with fits to circular and to\nequatorial Teukolsky-fluxes, we argue that the inclination grows also for\neccentric nearly horizon-skimming orbits.

The equation-of-motion approach is applied in studying\nboth the spin relaxation time $T_1$ and the spin dephasing time $T_2$, either\nin Markovian or in non-Markovian limit. When many levels are involved at finite\ntemperature, we demonstrate how to obtain the spin relaxation time from the\nFermi Golden rule in the limit of weak spin-orbit coupling. However, at high\ntemperature and/or for large spin-orbit coupling, one has to use the\nequation-of-motion approach when many levels are involved. Moreover, spin\ndephasing can be much more efficient than spin relaxation at high temperature,\nthough the two only differs by a factor of two at low temperature.\n", "title": "Reexamination of spin decoherence in semiconductor quantum dots from\n  equation-of-motion approach", "authors": "J.

The density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) technique is\ninvoked to study the properties of the system in the ground state, while the\ntransfer matrix renormalization group (TMRG) technique is applied to explore\nthe thermodynamic properties. The local magnetic moments, spin correlation\nfunctions, and static structure factors are discussed in the ground state for\nthe three cases. It is shown that the static structure factor S(q) shows peaks\nat wavevectors $q=a\\pi /3$ (a=0,1,2,3,4,5) for different couplings in a zero\nmagnetic field, which, however in the magnetic fields where the magnetization\nplateau with m=1/6 pertains, exhibits the peaks only at q=0, $2\\pi /3$ and\n$4\\pi /3$, which are found to be couplings-independent. The DMRG results of the\nzero-field static structure factor can be nicely fitted by a linear\nsuperposition of six modes, where two fitting equations are proposed. It is\nobserved that the six modes are closely related to the low-lying excitations of\nthe system.

{"abstract": "  The extraction of a physical law y=yo(x) from joint experimental data about x\nand y is treated. The joint, the marginal and the conditional probability\ndensity functions (PDF) are expressed by given data over an estimator whose\nkernel is the instrument scattering function. As an optimal estimator of yo(x)\nthe conditional average is proposed. The analysis of its properties is based\nupon a new definition of prediction quality. The joint experimental information\nand the redundancy of joint measurements are expressed by the relative entropy.\nWith the number of experiments the redundancy on average increases, while the\nexperimental information converges to a certain limit value. The difference\nbetween this limit value and the experimental information at a finite number of\ndata represents the discrepancy between the experimentally determined and the\ntrue properties of the phenomenon. The sum of the discrepancy measure and the\nredundancy is utilized as a cost function. By its minimum a reasonable number\nof data for the extraction of the law yo(x) is specified. The mutual\ninformation is defined by the marginal and the conditional PDFs of the\nvariables.

In particular, we report the highest state ever detected in the\nH band. The source varied by a factor of 4 in this band, much more than in the\nV band (a factor ~2). The source softened with increasing intensity, contrary\nto the general pattern observed in the UV-X-ray bands. On five nights of\nNovember we had nearly continuous monitoring for 2-3 hours. A variability\nepisode with a time scale of ~24 h is well documented, a much more rapid flare\nwith t=1-2 h, is also apparent, but is supported by relatively few points.\n", "title": "REM near-IR and optical multiband observations of PKS2155-304 in 2005", "authors": "A.

Spectral type standard star spectra scaled to the\ndereddened spectrum of A0620-00 in K exceed the A0620-00 spectrum in J and H\nfor all stars of spectral type K7V or earlier, demonstrating that the donor\nstar, unless later than K7V, cannot be the sole NIR flux source in A0620-00. In\naddition, the atomic absorption lines in the K3V spectrum are too weak with\nrespect to those of A0620-00 even at 100% donor star contribution, restricting\nthe spectral type of the donor star in A0620-00 to later than K3V.

Aims: This motivates planet searches around\nstars which are significantly more massive or less massive than the Sun, and in\nparticular our radial velocity search for planets around very-low mass stars.\nMethods: As part of that program, we obtained measurements of GJ 674, an M2.5\ndwarf at d=4.5 pc, which have a dispersion much in excess of their internal\nerrors. An intensive observing campaign demonstrates that the excess dispersion\nis due to two superimposed coherent signals, with periods of 4.69 and 35 days.\nResults: These data are well described by a 2-planet Keplerian model where each\nplanet has a ~11 Mearth minimum mass. A careful analysis of the (low level)\nmagnetic activity of GJ 674 however demonstrates that the 35-day period\ncoincides with the stellar rotation period. This signal therefore originates in\na spot inhomogeneity modulated by stellar rotation. The 4.69-day signal on the\nother hand is caused by a bona-fide planet, GJ 674b. Conclusion: Its detection\nadds to the growing number of Neptune-mass planets around M-dwarfs, and\nreinforces the emerging conclusion that this mass domain is much more populated\nthan the jovian mass range. We discuss the metallicity distributions of M dwarf\nwith and without planets and find a low 11% probability that they are drawn\nfrom the same parent distribution.

This result suggests that the assumption of forced accretion\nof cold matter that was adopted in previous studies of the evolution of double\nCO white dwarf merger remnants may not be appropriate. Our results imply that\nat least some products of double CO white dwarfs merger may be considered good\ncandidates for the progenitors of Type Ia supernovae. In this case, the\ncharacteristic time delay between the initial dynamical merger and the eventual\nexplosion would be ~10^5 yr.

{"abstract": "  Close pre-main-sequence binary stars are expected to clear central holes in\ntheir protoplanetary disks, but the extent to which material can flow from the\ncircumbinary disk across the gap onto the individual circumstellar disks has\nbeen unclear. In binaries with eccentric orbits, periodic perturbation of the\nouter disk is predicted to induce mass flow across the gap, resulting in\naccretion that varies with the binary period. This accretion may manifest\nitself observationally as periodic changes in luminosity. Here we present a\nsearch for such periodic accretion in the pre-main-sequence spectroscopic\nbinary UZ Tau E. We present BVRI photometry spanning three years; we find that\nthe brightness of UZ Tau E is clearly periodic, with a best-fit period of 19.16\n+/- 0.04 days. This is consistent with the spectroscopic binary period of 19.13\ndays, refined here from analysis of new and existing radial velocity data. The\nbrightness of UZ Tau E shows significant random variability, but the overall\nperiodic pattern is a broad peak in enhanced brightness, spanning more than\nhalf the binary orbital period. The variability of the H-alpha line is not as\nclearly periodic, but given the sparseness of the data, some periodic component\nis not ruled out. The photometric variations are in good agreement with\npredictions from simulations of binaries with orbital parameters similar to\nthose of UZ Tau E, suggesting that periodic accretion does occur from\ncircumbinary disks, replenishing the inner disks and possibly extending the\ntimescale over which they might form planets.\n", "title": "Periodic accretion from a circumbinary disk in the young binary UZ Tau E", "authors": "Eric L.

{"abstract": "  The ever-increasing knowledge of the structure of various real-world networks\nhas uncovered their complex multi-mechanism-governed evolution processes.\nTherefore, a better understanding of the structure and evolution of these\nnetworked complex systems requires us to describe such processes in a more\ndetailed and realistic manner. In this paper, we introduce a new type of\nnetwork growth rule which comprises addition and deletion of nodes, and propose\nan evolving network model to investigate the effect of node deleting on network\nstructure. It is found that, with the introduction of node deleting, network\nstructure is significantly transformed. In particular, degree distribution of\nthe network undergoes a transition from scale-free to exponential forms as the\nintensity of node deleting increases. At the same time, nontrivial\ndisassortative degree correlation develops spontaneously as a natural result of\nnetwork evolution in the model. We also demonstrate that node deleting\nintroduced in the model does not destroy the connectedness of a growing network\nso long as the increasing rate of edges is not excessively small. In addition,\nit is found that node deleting will weaken but not eliminate the small-world\neffect of a growing network, and generally it will decrease the clustering\ncoefficient in a network.\n", "title": "Effect of node deleting on network structure", "authors": "Ke Deng, Heping Zhao, Dejun Li", "doi": "10.1016/j.physa.2007.02.039", "aid": "0704.0308"},
